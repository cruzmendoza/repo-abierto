Books as signifiers, the paradox of tolerance, and Nazi bars</a>. 

> By doing so with signifiers rather than through action, communities mistakenly let these authoritarians and extremists recruit and spread their ideology of violence until preventing their violence becomes impossible. These ideas must be scorned by open societies if they wish to remain open.

One of your guests starts saying that society’s ills are caused by women not knowing their place and that the best way to fix society would be for all women to be beaten regularly.

> If you say nothing, or even limit yourself to polite objections, the women in your party will know that they aren’t safe there. Those who can leave will leave. Those who can refuse to attend the next party will refuse. Those who feel they _have to_ attend, because of their job or spouse, will go quiet and hope not to be noticed.

> Tolerating intolerant speech in your community, your social gatherings, and your immediate surroundings, will cause that intolerance and violent language to grow and take over the community and, quite often, actual violence will follow.

I need to think and write about this. Many different ideas pop in my mind while reading thi but I have to take the dog for a walk now. I believe that even Nazis have to be able to participate in the public space, and that they have to be mocked, scorned and heavily contested by the rest of that public space. No tolerance, but combative counter-speech. I think the author wants them cancelled, which is just useless. But I need to think about it.
