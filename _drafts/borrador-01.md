I've been thinking about this controversial post that [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/about) published:

> [Moral false dichotomies](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/moral-false-dichotomies)
>
> Now, some preferences can raise eyebrows: if I tell you my favorite book is the Mein Kampf, you have every reason to be perplexed and ask follow-up questions. But if you just assumed, based on that, that I’m a Nazi sympathizer, that would be wrong. Because you don’t actually know what. This is obviously Godwin's law in action, and I’m using an extreme example to make the point clear, but it applies to all sorts of more nuanced scenarios.

And this response that he received from [Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com):

> [The paradox of tolerance](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2026/paradox-of-tolerance/#the-paradox-of-tolerance)
>
> And I posted it with this response from me:
>
> What on earth possesses somebody to write this paragraph! If your favourite book is Mein Kampf then you are absolutely going to be a Nazi sympathiser, if not an outright Nazi.

> In hindsight, I'm pleasantly surprised that I didn't swear more. I guess I'm mellowing with age.

Almost every debate about free speech is extremely frustrating to me. Free speech means two things in my view: 

1. That I have the right to express whatever I want in public, any opinion I may have about any issue, any creation of my imagination that I want to share, any idea as weird, outrageous, offensive or provocative as it may be.
2. That I have the obligation to withstand whatever others express in public, any idea as weird, outrageous offensive or provocative as it may be.

Derived from those principles, there's these effects that I really believe in:

- As offended as I may feel, I don't have any right to expect that others accommodate their speech or their behavior to my feelings.
- I have every right and even duty to express my contempt for other opinions and share my counter-views with the public.

Having said that, I find very few people that really believe in free speech and are willing to let other people use it to its full extent.

Freedom will hardly prevail in the long run, because, as much as we love our own, we despise other people's freedom.

Now I want to express why I think Baldur is the real Nazi in this story.

He draws a conclusion about Manu's ideology based on an example the latter uses in his post. Baldur even makes a lengthy argument about the use of the example being as telling as a real ideological statement. He falls in the falacy of "intolerants must be met with intolerance". Karl Popper did not say that. He decides Manu can not be anything but a Nazi. That's actually the profiling that fanatics do. Baldur is the real Nazi.

I think Manu is far from being a right wing extremist, a Nazi sympathizer, a fascist italian. I don't even think he is conservative, but I don't really know. My first point is that his article was clearly giving a mere example, and that anyone with a minimum reading ability and not blinded by their own ideology could see that.

My second point is that, if Manu were actually a Nazi, he would have the right to express his view, and we would have the right and duty to respond. 

Baldur's actual thesis is that Nazi ideology has to be completely wiped out of the public agora. And that is, first, not posible, second, not good. The egg of the snake grows in the dark, and public light is the best antiseptic.
