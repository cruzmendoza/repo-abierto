I've been thinking about this controversial post that [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/about) published:

> [Moral false dichotomies](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/moral-false-dichotomies)
>
> Now, some preferences can raise eyebrows: if I tell you my favorite book is the Mein Kampf, you have every reason to be perplexed and ask follow-up questions. But if you just assumed, based on that, that I’m a Nazi sympathizer, that would be wrong. Because you don’t actually know what. This is obviously Godwin's law in action, and I’m using an extreme example to make the point clear, but it applies to all sorts of more nuanced scenarios.

And this response that he received from [Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com):

> [The paradox of tolerance](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2026/paradox-of-tolerance/#the-paradox-of-tolerance)
>
> And I posted it with this response from me:
>
> What on earth possesses somebody to write this paragraph! If your favourite book is Mein Kampf then you are absolutely going to be a Nazi sympathiser, if not an outright Nazi.
>
> In hindsight, I'm pleasantly surprised that I didn't swear more. I guess I'm mellowing with age.

Almost every debate about free speech is extremely frustrating for me.
