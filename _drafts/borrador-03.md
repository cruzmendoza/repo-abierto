> Macros
> 
> Keeping apps alive -- Runs every 10 minutes with a trigger of "If Raycast is not running" and an action of "Start Raycast."
> Log out cleanly -- One action quits all apps, the next pauses, then Keyboard Maestro ejects all disks and issues the logout command.

> Mark all mail as read -- Uses menu bar commands and simulated mouse clicks.
