Tahoe Added a Finder Option to Resize Columns to Fit Filenames</a>. 

> But now that we’ve been [poking around at column view](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/macos-26-tahoe-broke-column-view-in-the-finder) in the Tahoe Finder, [Jeff Johnson has discovered another enticing new feature](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2026/1/8.html). On Mac OS 26, the Finder has a new view option (accessed via View → Show View Options) to automatically resize columns to fit the longest visible filename. [See Johnson’s post](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2026/1/8.html) for screenshots of the new option in practice.

> Column view is one of the best [UI innovations from NeXTStep](https://infinitemac.org/1989/NeXTStep%201.0), and if you think about it, has always been the primary metaphor for browsing hierarchical applications in iOS. It’s a good idea for the desktop that proved foundational for mobile. The iPhone Settings app is column view — one column at a time. It’s a way to organize a multi-screen app in a visual, spatial way even when limited to a 3.5-inch display.

I’ve wanted this in List View for ages. I’m so tired of hunting for that tiny gap between columns just to double-click. This feature is honestly enough to make me switch to Column View for good.
