> Quite the different message (and medium — this time with nothing on Apple’s website, let alone their homepage) from 2020, for what I consider far more outrageous and alarming killings.

I really don’t get the last sentence. How can these killings be "far more outrageous and alarming" than George Floyd’s. Seriously, how?
Maybe they are as outrageous, but "far more"? I have to ask: is it because the victims in Minnesota were white this time? Does police brutality only become a bigger deal when it hits white people?
I’m white and privileged, but even I can see that the weak, the poor, and people of color have lived in fear for decades, centuries. Now that this fear is reaching white people, suddenly it’s "far more" alarming?
It’s the same violence, just a different target. Saying this time it’s worse feels wrong.
