> In case you need this spelled, no, I never in my life read the Mein Kampf the same way I never read many other books. And in case you also need this spelled, to clear the eventual confusion, I do think Hitler was bad in ways that are beyond comprehension. I visited the [Risiera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risiera_di_San_Sabba) when I was in elementary school, and the signs of those wars are very much still visible here. But that’s beside the point.

I wish Manu hadn't felt the need to explain this. It was crystal clear from the start. While initial confusion might be excused as a misunderstanding, doubling down on this aggressive criticism feels less like a debate and more like ideological bullying.
