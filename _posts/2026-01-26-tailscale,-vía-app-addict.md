> Tailscale lets you treat a collection of devices in different geographic locations as if they were all in the same building, plugged into the same network and connected to the same switch. In practice, you can link computers in your home, at your office, while staying in a hotel, and even machines belonging to family members. It works across platforms, and all traffic is end-to-end encrypted. You don’t mess with opening ports or exposing your home network to the internet. You don’t have to learn AWS, firewalls, or how to configure TLS certificates.
